<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
After LBO Krispy Kreme becomes "debt-free".  Krispy Kreme IPOs in 2000, and
then seeks to "aggressively" increase the number of stores.  What was the
percent growth in stores?
</p>

<p>
Talk about the
effect of aggressive expansion on the Balance sheet.  Discuss IGR and SGR.
Krispy Kreme will ultimately use "external financing" through new franchisee
fees.  What type of financing (debt or equity) is a financing fee?
</p>

<p>
Do you think KK had the balance sheet to expand as quickly as they proposed?
Could the bad accounting merely be a symptom of an overly aggressive expansion plan?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The human element&#x2014;what happens if a CEO can't deliver on a promise?</li>
</ul>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">

<div id="outline-container-org55698af" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org55698af"><span class="section-number-2">8.</span> Specific Accounting Problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-8">
<p>
KK was buying back franchises.  Common sense says this should cost KK, however due to the way they were booking it the purchases were a revenue <b>source</b>.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2558598" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org2558598"><span class="section-number-3">8.1.</span> Franchise Purchase Deal</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-8-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Franchisee closes stores and pays KK (corporate) accrued interest on past-due loans.</li>
<li>This was recorded on the income statement as interest income.  &lt;&#x2014; we are fine at this point.</li>
<li>The purchase cost of the franchise was booked as an intangible asset (reacquired franchise rights).</li>
<li>The implication is that the purchase price is not amortized, meaning it doesn't show up on the income statement.</li>
<li>Also severance payments were not amortized.</li>
<li>Net effect, buying back franchises increases income.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This treatment was <i>fine</i> by GAAP, but was not used by any other firms.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>So did the market think the company was using this accounting approach?</li>
<li>If not, what effect does this have on asymmetric information?  What about on stock volatility?</li>
